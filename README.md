## About
This repository contains miscallaneous programs written in assembly that can be
assembled using [nasm](https://nasm.us).

### Directory Structure
- `bin/`: Where the assembled and linked programs will be emitted.
- `lib/`: Utitily functions
  - `x64/`: In Linux 64bit calling convention
  - `x86/`: In Linux 32bit calling convention
- `src/`: The actual source files for the programs
  - `x64/`: In Linux 64bit calling convention
  - `x86/`: In Linux 32bit calling convention

## Assembling
1. First of all, you need a **Linux box or a Mac** to run these programs
(assembly is not very cross-platform).

2. You also need [nasm](nasm.us). See below for installation options.
   1. From the download page
   2. Via a package manager
      1. On **macOS** using [**Homebrew üç∫**](https://brew.sh): `brew install nasm`
      2. On **Debian** based systems using **apt-get**: `sudo apt-get install nasm`
3. GCC Compiler tools (for `make` and `ld`)
   1. On macOS, install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) or 'the command line tools'
   2. On Linux install gcc
      1. Debian based systems: `sudo apt-get install gcc`

4. Finally, to assemble and link the programs, run `make`

Now in the `bin` directory, you should see various programs (depending on your 
machine's architecture).
